Ok, the Test 3: The "Fire and Forget" Async Queue was almost successful, except one small issue; while I hit the send request, the response was immediate, and gradually I get the following logs:
[a17622db-828e-4c36-8d92-cdab16acf56d] POST /api/v1/auth/forgot-password 200 65.675 ms
info: 📧 Processing Email Job: RESET_PASSWORD for test@enterprise.com {"timestamp":"2026-01-05T20:00:38.908Z"}
info: ✅ Email Job Completed: 1 {"timestamp":"2026-01-05T20:00:45.318Z"}


I am concerned why I didn't see the [MOCK EMAIL] log.



Also, for the Test 4: Organization Invite, when I hit the send request, I do get the 201 response, but the it took 3.71 seconds. Does that require any fix?
